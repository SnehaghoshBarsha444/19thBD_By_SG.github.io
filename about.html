            <p>I am a passionate learner about coding, programming, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity, always driven by curiosity and the desire to explore new realms of knowledge. My interests extend to human psychology and literature, reflecting my fascination with both the technical and human sides of life. Guided by a strong sense of discipline and punctuality, I hold my values close and expect the same respect in return.
                <br>
                Authenticity is at the core of who I am, and I strive to be accepted for who I am without compromise. I find joy in helping others quietly, without seeking recognition, and I am deeply connected to my belief in the divine and the eternal nature of the soul. With purpose and resilience, I approach life's challenges, balancing a warrior’s spirit with a compassionate heart.<br><br><br>
